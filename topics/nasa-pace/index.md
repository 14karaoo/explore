PACE [launched into Earth orbit][launch] on 2024-02-08 and is extending and improving NASA's over 20-year satellite observation record of global ocean biology, aerosols (tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere), and clouds.
The mission aims to assess ocean health by measuring the distribution of phytoplankton (tiny plants and algae that sustain the marine food web).
It also improves measurement of key atmospheric variables associated with air quality and Earth's climate.

There are two science instruments on the PACE satellite:
- The Ocean Color Instrument ([OCI]) is a spectrometer that measures intensity of light over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum: ultraviolet (UV), visible, near infrared, and several shortwave infrared bands.
  OCI enables continuous measurement of light at finer wavelength resolution than previous NASA ocean color sensors, providing detailed information on our global ocean.
  The color of the ocean is determined by the interaction of sunlight with substances or particles present in seawater such as chlorophyll, a green photosynthetic pigment found in phytoplankton and land plants.
- The multi-angle polarimeters [HARP2] and [SPEXone] are radiometers that measures how the oscillation of sunlight within a geometric plane - known as its polarization - is changed by passing through clouds, aerosols, and the ocean.
  Measuring polarization states of UV-to-shortwave light at various angles provides new information on the atmosphere and clouds, such as particle size and composition.
